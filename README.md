# Flatland Challenge

This is the reference code for an assignment submission for the Flatland challenge.

This is deliberately not a runnable instance of the game, and likely will be of limited use to anyone coming across this for class assignments as it requires a specific package (lib_piglet) for many relevant data structures.

Nonetheless this demonstrates implementations of Time Expanded A-Star, Safe Interval Path Planning, Large Neighbourhood Search (in MAPF contexts with random neighbourhoods) along with an attempt at a domain specific replan mechanism.
All details explained in the report_flatland.pdf.

This codebase should be used as reference only. Any ideas and code here should be cited (see report_flatland.pdf as an example).
